# Teacher Reacher

As schools begin to reopen during an uncertain pandemic, the look of classrooms and how they operate are constantly having to adjust to a new normal. This requires new ideas, technologies and methods of learning - which can be difficult! It also allows the opportunity to level the playing field for many students by opening their resources to learn and quality of education to more than their specific school system or geographic location. This program will help connect students within a classroom (and beyond!) to other students who can share their notes, work together on assignments, and teach each other. This is part note taker, part tutor, part social media site. “By teaching, we learn."

# User Story

As a teacher:

I want an app where my students can post notes, assignments and resources with their fellow classmates.
And as part of their learning process, I’d like for my students to schedule tutor sessions to work with each other where they can ask questions, share what they’ve learned, and deepen their understanding through collaboration.

I want access to my grade book so I can enter, edit, save, and view grades for all of my students.

As a student:
I want an app where I can create, view, and submit my notes and assignments, as well as schedule tutoring sessions with other students.
I want an app where I can check my updated grades.
